# Energy_Management_System
A distributed system designed to allow users owning multiple embedded devices to aggregate and visualize the energy consumption of them. Also, it allows admins to manage the users, and their devices. The design follows a microservice-oriented architecture and I used technologies such as Docker, RabbitMQ, Spring Security and more.
